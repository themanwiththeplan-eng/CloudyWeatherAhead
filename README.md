## What it does

This weather dashboard allows you to type in a city, and then get the weather information not only for the city at the current time, but also for the next 5 days as well. It uses two API calls, a geo-locater that gives you longitude and langitude, then saves that as a variable and calls the OneCallAPI to get weather information regarding those coordinates.
